					<h2>Hi! I'm Angelo Josua P. Guizano, a 19 year-old 1st year college student that studies at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig.</h2>
					<p>I'm the eldest son in my family. I have a sister whose 2 years younger than me. She's currently a Grade 12 student at Cainta Senior High School.</p>
					<p>I like to eat chocolates and drink coffee while I watch anime. I love playing mobile games like Growtopia, Soul Knight, and Osu! droid.</p>

					<h1><span class="underline">Other Stuff About Me</span></h1>
					<p>I don't have any particular skills or talent. I don't excel at drawing, singing, dancing, or any talents you can find on other people.</p>
					<p>My only strength I could be proud of is being a determined hardworker. I love to learn anything about programming. Even it is very hard one, I always try my hardest to understand the lessons.</p>
					
					<p>One of my many weaknesses is being very forgetful. I often forget the lessons that was discussed an hour or two ago. I find this weakness very annoying, because sometimes my mind just go blank even though I memorized a certain thing. </p>
					<p>After I graduate, I see myself as a software developer. Maybe because it is a close job to my dream of becoming a game developer. I hope I managed to get rid of my annoying weakness before I graduate at college. </p>
